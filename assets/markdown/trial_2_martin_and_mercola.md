# <!-- fit --> Trial 2 - [US patent 7279327B2: _Methods for producing recombinant coronavirus_](https://patents.google.com/patent/US7279327B2/en)

Welcome back to July 2021, and meet today's protagonist: _dad_ 👨🏽👍🏽, also known as **SARS-CoV-1**.

With **SARS-CoV-2**, they make up **the same** [SARSr-CoV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS-related_coronavirus) **species**, and are about 79% genetically identical (= making the same proteins). Putting the number in perspective:

:one: Two random humans are 99.8% identical 👨🏽👨🏿
:two: A human and a chimp: 98% 👨🏽🐵
:three: A human and a mouse: 85% 👨🏽:mouse:

...and then you have our two coronaviruses at 79% :alien:👾

## <!-- fit -->Heard you like reading, so we put some reading in your reading so you can read while you read

:us: _Citizen's Journal_ opens its [_Patents Prove SARS-CoV-2 Is A Manufactured Virus_](https://www.citizensjournal.us/patents-prove-sars-cov-2-is-a-manufactured-virus/) with [a list of every SARS-CoV-1-related patent](https://www.m-cam.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/20200403_SARS_CoV_Patent_Corpus_Lit_Review.pdf) known to man :books::closed_book::books::skull:

![Long patent list is long](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13955209/180362167-acb11ccb-84f2-41c2-b8aa-057299192b51.gif) ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13955209/180490661-0a8d2e02-5150-4aeb-9888-b3cb037a1185.png)

## Your first time reading patents = violent reality shifts ahead :scream:

Luckily, the article does go on to narrow the list down a bit. If it is one's first run-in with the biotechnology patents world, one is probably in for some :zap: shock:

- [Canine coronavirus S[pike] gene and uses therefor](https://patents.google.com/patent/US6057436A/en)
    - filed for by Pfizer in 1993 :arrow_right: granted 2000
    - the first contact with a spiked coronavirus had taken place in the 1970s, when military sentry :dog::dog: (:de: shepherds) suffered a violent diarrhea epidemic
    - suggests spike injection into other viruses, for targetting other species :grin::+1::+1:
- [Coronavirus isolated from humans](https://patents.google.com/patent/US7220852B1/en)
    - filed by Centers of Disease Control and Prevention in 2004 :arrow_right: granted 2007
    - patents a naturally occurring, living thing (though it took a few tries) :woman_shrugging:

## <!-- fit --> The favourite appears, blowing the competition out of the water :dancer: 
<br>

* [_Methods for producing recombinant coronavirus_](https://patents.google.com/patent/US7279327B2/en) :dna::scissors::dna:
	* _'An infectious replication-defective coronavirus, specifically targeted for human lung epithelium'_ :lungs:
	*  _'Several months after that patent filing, the SARS outbreak in Asia occurred'_ 
	* _'In other words, we made SARS'_ :thinking:


<br>Well done, marketing team - it's very hard to resist :heart_eyes: (...checking whether the SARS-CoV-1 genetic sequence matches the methods therein). What's inside? :eyes:

## No trivial matter... or is it? :wink:

 ![patent images](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13955209/180583567-7ecf5f5d-d9be-4e0f-b4dc-e16ec47da549.gif)

Looks scarily complex :speak_no_evil: But what subset actually applies to SARS-CoV-1?

---

## <!-- fit -->Working _a posteriori_, information selection almost feels like cheating :grin:

Since SARS-CoV-1 already exists :arrow_right: we know its structure :arrow_right: we can discard any instructions leading to a different structure.

- **Note:** we're sticking with SARS-CoV-1's earliest accession at version [.3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_004718.3) - as it conveniently lists gene begin/end coordinates (unlike the earlier versions [.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_004718.1) or [.2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_004718.2))

![SARS-CoV-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13955209/180600804-17b8bdd2-700c-49d9-bd9b-6ceedf1c4696.png)

Paying attention to just the coloured-in structural genes, their order is **S, E, M , N** :pencil:
No need to investigate the other 2 paths in the patent: **S**, **N**, **E**, **M**, **N** or **S**, **N**, **E**, **M** :woman_shrugging:

## The :pig::pig: are glowing green: meet the patent's protagonists

 The patent uses:
- _Transmissible gastroenteritis virus_ (**TGEV**) as **the backbone** :bone:
  - other sequences are inserted into it :arrow_up:
- _Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus_ (**PRRSV**) as **an insert** :key:
  - the "visitor" being inserted into the backbone
- _Green fluorescent protein_ (**GFP**) as **another insert** :key:

# Adventure 1: [The Yan report](https://zenodo.org/record/4028830#.X1_bxGhKg2y)

In September 2020, the above claimed to **be** scientific evidence for SARS-CoV-2 being an engineered bioweapon :raised_eyebrow: Despite the report not being peer-reviewed, Zenodo granted the report some credibility by assigning it a Digital Object Identifier (DOI).

<br>The Johns Hopkins University readily countered with a [page-by-page account](https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-work/pubs_archive/pubs-pdfs/2020/200921-in-response-yan.pdf) of why they thought the report unconvincing. Alas, neither their authority, nor having to read a mountain of references, were going to appeal to the conspiratorial part of the audience :thinking:

Critical thinking only requires that the core claim be verified - when that turns out to be false, everything derived from it automatically becomes false as well :woman_shrugging: What was the postulate, then, that was good enough to allow its publishers to seek asylum abroad?

## Restriction enzymes around the spike protein receptor binding motif

Mikolaj Raszek, PhD, was kind enough to elucidate, in [SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus origins alternative theories – do they hold up against science?](https://merogenomics.ca/blog/en/117/SARS-CoV-2_coronavirus_origins_alternative_theories__do_they_hold_up_against_science_Part_2), the core claim of the Yan report.

Two restriction enzymes (sequences bacteria use to slash viruses to bits, also used by humans to glue parts of different genomes together): [EcoRI](https://www.neb.com/products/r0101-ecori#Product%20Information) and [BstEII](https://www.neb.com/products/r0162-bsteii#Product%20Information). They allowed to - according to Yan et al - maliciously insert a large-mammal-targetting protein.

## Downloading the SARS-CoV-2 genome :arrow_down: (1 of 2)

<br>Yan et al's image caption cites the isolate **Wuhan-Hu-1** (isolate: a population of organisms having little genetic mixing with other organisms of the species).

<br>Viewing [the isolate at _NCBI Virus_](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus/vssi/#/virus?SeqType_s=Nucleotide&VirusLineage_ss=Severe%20acute%20respiratory%20syndrome%20coronavirus%202,%20taxid:2697049&IsolateParsed_s=Wuhan-Hu-1), the oldest available accession is [NC_045512](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_045512), submitted on 2020-01-05.

<br>That's over 2 months before the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic ☣️ (2020-03-11).

## Downloading the SARS-CoV-2 genome :arrow_down: (2 of 2)

Switching to the FASTA format (a text format often used to store full genomes) allows us to download the SARS-CoV-2 troublemaker:

As far as genomes go, this one's really tiny - a hundred thousand times shorter than the human one. The human one would eat up 3.3 GB of your hard drive - and that's just a single cell :scream_cat:

## Are EcoRI and BstEII _actually there_? :mag::eyes:

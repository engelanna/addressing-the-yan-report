# Verifying SARS-CoV-2 origin hypotheses

Granted, this repo's a tad woo-woo :zany_face: But you're guaranteed to **both** have fun, **and** learn something cool - so, dig in :pick: The prezzies are self-contained, so clicking any external links is fully optional :woman_shrugging:

:tada: Yaaaay, I got GitHub pages + [Marp](https://marp.app/) transitions working! :heart: You need to enable `documentTransition API` in your browser's `about://flags` to see them, though.

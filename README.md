# Addressing the Yan report

Granted, this repo's a tad woo-woo :zany_face: But you're guaranteed to **both** have fun, **and** learn something cool - so dig in :pick: We won't be taking any sides - instead, finding verifiable hypotheses, and putting them to an actual test :mag:

:tada: Yay, I got [Marp](https://marp.app/) transitions working with GitHub pages :heart: You need to enable `documentTransition API` in your browser's `about://flags` to see the transitions, though.
